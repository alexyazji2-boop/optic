# Decisions

Each entry: what was decided, why, and what would change it.

**D-001 (setup) Work from production, in its own worktree.** Branch `post-demo-ultra` cut from origin/main
`9fa0f36`, which is what theopticterminal.com serves. The shared checkout's local `main` is 704 commits behind
origin and holds other sessions' uncommitted edits; it is left exactly as it was (master rule: preserve
pre-existing uncommitted changes).

**D-002 (setup) Nothing leaves this machine.** The branch has no upstream and is never pushed. Every phase says
"Do not deploy" and the master rules forbid deploys and production-data changes without explicit
authorization, so the owner's older standing instruction to push finished work does not apply here. The
owner's 2026-10-29 "You have permission to do whatever is necessary for this task" is read as covering local
engineering, local servers, local copies of data, test accounts and fixtures. It is not read as permission to
deploy, push, write production data, link real brokerage accounts or change billing, because the task's own
text excludes those.

**D-003 (setup) The directives are saved verbatim.** The overnight controller says they were saved in the
repository; a search of every checkout, docs folder and Downloads found no copy. They are in `directives/`
exactly as sent, so they survive context compaction. Interpretations go here, never into those files.

**D-004 (setup) One phase at a time, nothing left behind.** The owner's sequencing instruction (directive 13)
makes every phase a gate: the next phase starts only when the previous one's requirements are PASS or
BLOCKED / UNVERIFIED for a named external reason.
